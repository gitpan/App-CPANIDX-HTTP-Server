DESCRIPTION
    App::CPANIDX::HTTP::Server is a HTTP::Server::Simple based server for
    CPANIDX. Use the "cpanidx-gendb" script provided by App::CPANIDX to
    generate a CPANIDX database and then use this module to serve the
    associated data.

METHODS
    "new"
        Start a new instance of App::CPANIDX::HTTP::Server. Takes one
        option, the port number to start listening on for requests. If it is
        not provided will default to 8080.

    "dsn"
        After running "new", but before calling "run", call this to assign
        the database details to the server. Takes three arguments: a DBI
        "DSN" string, a username (if applicable) and a password (if
        applicable).

    "run"
        Runs the server and starts handling requests.

    "handle_request"
        Deals with requests. No user serviceable parts.
